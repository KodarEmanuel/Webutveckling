        <h2><em>Low and Slow</em></h2>
        <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
            cooking technique called <cite>sous vide.</cite> In sous vide
            cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
            in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
            set to the target temperature you want the food
            to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,
            Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature
            poaching.</p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
                with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
                table, contact us before November 30.</p>

                    <p><i>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not
                            pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
                            immunity issues.</i></p>
